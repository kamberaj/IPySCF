NAME
    basis_set_exchange.misc - Miscellaneous helper functions

FUNCTIONS
    basis_name_from_filename(filename)
        Given a basis set name that was part of a filename, determine the basis set name
        
        This is opposite of :func:`transform_basis_name`
        
        Pass only the part of the filename that contains the basis set name
    
    basis_name_to_filename(name)
        Given a basis set name, transform it into a valid filename
        
        This makes sure filenames don't contain invalid characters
    
    compact_elements(elements)
        Create a string (with ranges) given a list of element numbers
        
        For example, [1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 10] will return "H-Li,C-O,Ne"
    
    contraction_string(element)
        Forms a string specifying the contractions for an element
        
        ie, (16s,10p) -> [4s,3p]
    
    expand_elements(compact_el, as_str=False)
        Create a list of integers given a string or list of compacted elements
        
        This is partly the opposite of compact_elements, but is more flexible.
        
        compact_el can be a list or a string. If compact_el is a list, each element is processed individually
        as a string (meaning list elements can contain commas, ranges, etc)
        If compact_el is a string, it is split by commas and then each section is processed.
        
        In all cases, element symbols (case insensitive) and Z numbers (as integers or strings)
        can be used interchangeably. Ranges are also allowed in both lists and strings.
        
        Some examples:
            "H-Li,C-O,Ne" will return [1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 10]
            "H-N,8,Na-12" will return [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12]
            ['C', 'Al-15,S', 17, '18'] will return [6, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]
        
        If as_str is True, the list will contain strings of the integers
        (ie, the first example above will return ['1', '2', '3', '6', '7', '8', '10']
    
    max_am(shells)
        Determine the maximum angular momentum of a list of shells or potentials
    
    transform_basis_name(name)
        Transforms the name of a basis set to an internal representation
        
        This makes comparison of basis set names easier by, for example,
        converting the name to all lower case.
    
    transpose_matrix(mat)
        Transposes a matrix (list of lists) commonly done do coefficients
