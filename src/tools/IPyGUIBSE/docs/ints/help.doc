DESCRIPTION
    Written by Susi Lehtola, 2020

FUNCTIONS
    gamma(x, /)
        Gamma function at x.
    
    gto_R_contr(exps0, contr0, l)
        Computes the r matrix in the contracted basis, assuming the basis
        functions are of the spherical form r^l \sum_i c_i exp(-z_i r^2).
        The function also takes care of proper normalization.
    
    gto_Rsq_contr(exps0, contr0, l)
        Computes the r^2 matrix in the contracted basis, assuming the basis
        functions are of the spherical form r^l \sum_i c_i exp(-z_i r^2).
        The function also takes care of proper normalization.
    
    gto_overlap_contr(exps0, contr0, l)
        Computes the overlap matrix in the contracted basis, assuming the
        basis functions are of the spherical form r^l \sum_i c_i exp(-z_i
        r^2).
    
    sqrt(x, /)
        Return the square root of x.
    
    sto_Rsq_contr(exps0, contr0, ns0)
        Computes the r^2 matrix in the contracted basis, assuming the basis
        functions are of the spherical form r^(n-1) exp(-z r).
    
    sto_overlap_contr(exps0, contr0, ns0)
        Computes the overlap matrix in the contracted basis, assuming the
        basis functions are of the spherical form r^(n-1) exp(-z r).
